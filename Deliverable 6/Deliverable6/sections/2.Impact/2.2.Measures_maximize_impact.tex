\section{Measures to maximise impact}

\subsection{Dissemination and exploitation of the results}

One of the most important parts of the project is the maximization of the impact of the products. This can be achieved by carrying out an exhaustive dissemination and exploitation of the results. Through a proper Dissemination Management Plan, the actions, needs and requirements for satisfactory results are defined. 

\textbf{Dissemination Management Plan}

The Dissemination Management Plan is designed in order to fulfil the dissemination and exploitation of the results of the project. The actions to perform are defined from the starting point of the project to the last stages after the project. It contains information about internal, stakeholders and external communication.

\end{figure}

Although internal communication is very important for the proper development of the project, we must not forget that external communication is also crucial in a project of this magnitude. Having a good dissemination plan involves explaining how the outcomes of the project will be shared with stakeholders, relevant institutions, organisations, and individuals. \\
In order to achieve the proposed objectives in terms of external communication, the process of dissemination will be focused  in two different ways depending on whether we want to reach the general public or aerospace sector.

\textbf{General public}

It is important to find an adequate channel to reach the less specialized public in the aerospace field. In order to achieve the maximum diffusion of the project in this sector,  the following resources will be used.

\begin{itemize}
	\item{ 
		\textbf{Social Networking.} Social networks are the best way to reach the widest possible audience. Posting regularly is also crucial to keep people interested in the project. Some of the platforms that will be used during the project development are: Twitter, Linkedin, Facebook, and Instagram. There will be at least one update a week in order to keep people informed of the progress of the project.
	}
	\item {
		\textbf{Website.} A project website is one of the most versatile dissemination tools and will help to reach people unfamiliar with social networks. It can contain information intended to different profiles. As in the previous case, it has to be kept updated.
	}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Aerospace sector}


\begin{itemize}
	
	\item{
		\textbf{Trade shows.} Trade shows, fairs, and exhibitions are a great way to get in close contact with people from other regions and countries that we would ordinarily never be face to face with. They are also helpful in terms of finding new prospects, nurture current client relationships and stay up to date on the latest industry developments. 
	}
	\item {
		\textbf{Conferences.} National and international conferences will help to share the achievements of the project with specialists in the field.
	}
	\item {
		\textbf{Journal Articles.} To promote project ideas and results in scientific research.
	}
\end{itemize}



\textbf{Information Management}

\textbf{Knowledge Management}

Knowledge management is the process of creating, sharing, using and managing the knowledge and information of an organisation. In the case of this project, the produced information has been classified into three groups that are explained below.

The first one consists of the public information of the project such as social media publications, the overall status of the project, open conferences, etc. The second will have the project status reports and deliverables and will be available to all the stakeholders. Finally, the third one, and the most restrictive, will be formed by confidential information, for instance, the technical methodologies and systems.

\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/knowledgement.png}
	\caption{Levels of confidentiality} 
	\label{knowledge}
\end{figure}

All this information will be located in a private server and published in a website. Each group will have its own password to access to the Open, Green or Gold levels.


\subsection{Communication activities}

The following table shows the main communication actions in order to ensure a proper dissemination. It is also presented the medium, frequency, audience, owner, deliverable and format.
