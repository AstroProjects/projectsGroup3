\section{Objectives}

Overall, the main objective of the project is to enhance the performance of the EO systems so as to use the information derived from data to build a greener future. More specifically, the focus is on the improvement of both optical and radar systems and how they can contribute to the sustainable development of cities. Accordingly, in order to implement this solution some specific objectives have to be accomplished.

In fact, the key objectives for this project are:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Improve EO sensors technologies in terms of reliability, size, resolution, efficiency and accuracy.

	\item Manufacture a technology demonstrator prototype.

	\item Simulate, test and validate the demonstrator prototype manufactured in relevant environment.

	\item Develop a data processing software with machine learning algorithms focused on urban sustainable development applications. 

	\item Develop a web based server for data sharing. 

	\item Provide a technology that helps urban sustainable development, improving the European society.
 
\end{enumerate}
