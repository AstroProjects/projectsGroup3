\section{Objectives}

\textit{Describe the overall and specific objectives for the project1, which should be clear, measurable, realistic and achievable within the duration of the project. Objectives should be consistent with the expected exploitation and impact of the project (see section 2). }

-----------------------------------------
Overall, the main objective of the project is to enhance the performance of the
EO systems so as to use the information derived from data to build a greener future. More
specifically, the focus is on the improvement of both optical and radar systems and how can
they contribute to the sustainable development of cities. Accordingly, in order to implement this solution some specific objectives have to be accomplished.

In fact, the key objectives for this project are:

\begin{enumerate}

	\item Improve EO sensor's technologies in terms of reliability, size, resolution, efficiency and accuracy.

	\item Manufacture a technology demonstrator prototype.

	\item Simulate, test and validate the demonstrator prototype manufactured in relevant environment.

	\item Develop a data processing software with machine learning algorithms focused on urban sustainable development applications. 

	\item Develop a web based server for data sharing. 

	\item Provide a technology that helps urban sustainable development, improving the European society.
 
\end{enumerate}
