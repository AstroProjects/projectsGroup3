The next table includes all the information related with the ethical assessment regarding collecting or processing personal data. First of all, it is important to define the concepts of 'personal data' and 'processing of personal data'. Personal data includes any information about an identified person. 'Processing of personal data' includes all the operations done using personal data of a person.\\
