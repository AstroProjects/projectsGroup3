\section{Management structure, milstones and procedures}

\subsection{Organisational Structure}

A complex organizational structure has been established given the complexity and scale of the project. On top of the organizational chain, a steering committee has been created and it will provide DEOS-UD with strategic command and solutions to problems that affect a significant part of the stakeholders in order to ensure a correct and efficient development of the project. Hand-to-hand with the steering committee, the advisory committee will provide the project leaders with tailored assistance in order to assure time and cost-efficient decisions are taken. There is also a business project team which will be in charge of assuring an economical resources correct management by providing careful tracing in the use of the budget along with a proper staff training in means of economic performance; the team is also ought to keep the steering committee updated with the latest information on earned value management parameters so that appropriate decisions are taken. Reinforcing the organizational structure of the project, a technical project team has been created as well in order to provide control over technical decisions in the project.
An organizational structure directed by a steering committee is specifically designed to fit such a large-scale and long-term project as this one is. The experience, capacities and diversity of the members it is composed by will play a key role in the outcome of the project while maintaining an efficient use of time and resources. The steering committee will take major decisions involving a significant fraction of the stakeholders. The business project team will be in charge of assessing the decisions involving budget modification or inter-department budget redistribution. Finally, decisions involving a modification or significant change in the technologies used during DEOS-UD progress will be in hands of the technical project team. Smaller affairs along with local inconveniences will be solved by the specific group affected by them. By having such a decision making distribution, DEOS-UD ensures a correct importance of the decision to experience ratio and thus assuring a more efficient time usage by providing every person within DEOS-UD with fitted responsibilities.
The milestones to accomplish are detailed in the following section; extracted from the third deliverable.
