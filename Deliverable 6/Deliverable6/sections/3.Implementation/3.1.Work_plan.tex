\section{Work plan — Work packages, deliverables}

The present section accounts for an accurate description of the different steps and milestones needed to be accomplished by DEOS-UD in order to succeed in the development of the project. The reader will find here information related with the overall structure of the project, the different Work Packages and their timings along with the list of deliverables and milestones expected for the project. In addition to the information described, an approach to the interrelation between components will be displayed in order for the reader to better understand the complexity of the project.  

\subsection{Overall Structure}
%Brief presentation of the overall structure of the work plan. \textbf{Network diagram SOLO de los WP o diagrama explicativo del proyecto. El network diagram que tenemos ahora está en D2 Apartado 3.2.}

The DEOS-UD project is composed by 7 different work packages which are interrelated as shown in Figure \ref{overallstructure}. WP1 deals with project management and will ensure the proper coordination of project activities and the achievement of project objectives. WP2 is related to the quality and the administration of the project in terms of human resources, documentation management and quality, periodic monitoring and will also establish the financial plan of the project. WP3 will study the current baseline designs for the studied technologies (payload, modular system and urban development application) in the sector and will establish the potential areas of improvement and the requirements needed to achieve the new technologies proposed. WP4 is in charge of designing the output products of the project. This WP is strongly related to WP5 which is in charge of manufacturing and validating the prototype. Good intercommunication between these WPs is needed in order to obtain a final product that meets the requirements imposed by WP3. WP6 aims to create a methodology to enable the future use of the new technologies developed during the project, assuring their continuity. Finally, WP7 will ensure the project results are communicated and disseminated to the appropriate audiences, establishing new knowledge into society.

\subsection{Timing of the Work Plan}

The following GANTT diagram contains all the tasks planned for the Project, with their chronological order and duration. The GANTT diagram serves as a base for the project resource planning and time management.

\subsection{Description of Work Packages}

\begin{itemize}

\item List of WP. \textbf{D2 Apartado 2.1 Poner solo WP, no todas las activities. Extraer del D2 también Start Month i End Month}

\item Description of each WP. \textbf{Extraer información de D2 sección 2 (Número de participantes, líder, objetivos, etc.) Hay que poner las diferentes tareas dentro de cada WP y quienes participan en cada tarea. Importante: Falta calcular PM por participante. Deliverables asociados a cada WP ( también a extraer del D2).}
