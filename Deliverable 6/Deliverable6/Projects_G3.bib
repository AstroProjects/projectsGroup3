abstract = {The Horizon 2020 Framework Programme represents a radically new and comprehensive approach to the EU's research and innovation funding policies. The Rules for Participation and Dissemination are designed to implement this new approach in a way that researchers and businesses can benefit from it to the fullest extent. The new provisions ensure that the three key objectives of the new Framework Programme – integration of support to innovation, coherence of the rules and simplification for the benefit of participants – will be realised. A seamless innovation chain A single set of rules is now applicable to the whole innovation chain, ranging from frontier research over technological development to " close to market " applications. Important new features are for instance the possibility to award grants to single beneficiaries as well as new funding schemes such as pre-commercial procurement and procurement for innovative solutions, which are specifically targeted at innovation. Moreover, specific provisions on minimum conditions and IPR should facilitate the participation of innovative SMEs. Finally, the Rules provide for EU's loan and equity-based financial instruments, which will allow tailor-made financial support for innovative enterprises and may be combined with Horizon 2020 grants. Coherence The Rules will establish a common legal frame for the formerly separated research (FP) and innovation (CIP) programmes. Moreover, as a general principle they will equally apply to all other Horizon 2020 funding bodies such as the Article 185 TFEU initiatives, the Joint Technology Initiatives and the European Institute of Technology. Great care has been taken to ensure coherence of this legal frame with all other EU funding programmes. To this end the Rules have been strongly aligned to the new Financial Regulation which entered into force in January 2013 and which is applicable to all EU funding programmes. Finally, the Rules foresee the possibility of cumulative funding between Horizon 2020 and other EU funding programmes. Simplification: a major feature of Horizon 2020 Horizon 2020 has been constructed from the outset around a radical simplification of its architecture, rules, procedures and control strategy, to attract the top researchers and the most innovative enterprises.},

abstract = {By ensuring that your project management knowledge and frameworks are up-to-date, PMI's global standards are the foundation of the profession. A Guide to the Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK{\textregistered} Guide) —Fifth Edition reflects the collaboration and knowledge of working project managers and provides the fundamentals of project management as they apply to a wide range of projects. This internationally recognized standard gives project managers the essential tools to practice project management and deliver organizational results. • A 10th Knowledge Area has been added; Project Stakeholder Management expands upon the importance of appropriately engaging project stakeholders in key decisions and activities. • Project data information and information flow have been redefined to bring greater consistency and be more aligned with the Data, Information, Knowledge and Wisdom (DIKW) model used in the field of Knowledge Management. • Four new planning processes have been added: Plan Scope Management, Plan Schedule Management, Plan Cost Management and Plan Stakeholder Management: These were created to reinforce the concept that each of the subsidiary plans are integrated through the overall project management plan.},
