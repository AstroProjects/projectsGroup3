SUMMARY OF THE DOCUMENTS
------------------------

1) GUIDANCE FOR EVALUATORS OF HORIZON 2020 PROPOSALS - 8 pages
--------------------------------------------------------------

1.1) HOW ADRESS INNOVATION?

- RESEARCH AND INNOVATION ACTION:  Activities aiming to establish new knowledge and/or to explore the feasibility of a new or improved technology. 
  They may include basic and applied research, technology development and integration, testing and validation on a small-scale prototype in a laboratory or simulated environment. 

- KEY ASPECTS: 
  + EXCELLENCE (innovation potential,impact)
  + QUALITY (innovation management,work plan)  
  + EFFICIENCY OF IMPLEMENTATION

1.2) HOW ADRESS SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES?

- Take into account the social, economic, behavioural, institutional, historical and/or cultural dimensions

1.3) HOW ADRESS RESPONSIBLE RESEARCH?

- Open access to scientific publications
- Education and training may form part

1.4) HOW ADRESS PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT (Compromiso de la sociedad)?

- Not rellevant

1.5) HOW ADRESS GENDER DIMENSION?

- A topic is considered gender relevant when it can be expected that its findings affect women and men or groups of women and men differently => DOESN'T APPLY

1.6) HOW ADRESS TRANS-DISCIPLINARITY?

- Refers to approaches and methodologies that integrate as necessary (a) theories, concepts, knowledge, data, andtechniques from two or more scientific disciplines

1.7) HOW ADRESS INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION?

- It is interesting to include international cooperation in the project


1.8) HOW ADRESS COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES?

- The communication activities must make the research activities known to multiple audiences by considering aspects: Scientific excellence, transnational cooperation, competitiveness to solving societal challenges
- Good communication will: 
   Start at the outset of the action and continue throughout its entire lifetime
   Be strategically planned
   Identify and set clear communication objectives
   Be targeted and adapted to audiences that go beyond the project’s own community
   Use the right medium and means
   Be proportionate to the scale of the action


2) 19. GENERAL ANNEXES - 36 pages
---------------------------------

- This document includes all the points that the rest of the people had to look at. 
- It doesn't provide additional information


3) 5. LEADERSHIP IN ENABLING AND INDUSTRIAL TECHNOLOGIES; iii. SPACE - 92 pages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- This document presents all the calls that exist for the SPACE sector in 
  H2020 (2014-2020) --> Prepare for the increasing role of space in the future and reap the benefits of space now
- OPTIONAL: Open Research Data Pilot which aims to improve and maximise access to and re-use of research data generated by projects. Available in the participants portal.
- CHALLENGE: 
    * Protection of space infrastructure and in particular the setting up of a Space Surveillance and Tracking system (SST) at European level
    * Earth Observation reaping (acoger) the benefits they can generate in the coming years and ensuring their state-of-the-art also in the future
    * Ensuring that Europe’s investments made in space infrastructure are exploited to the benefit of citizens
    * Enhancing Europe’s standing as attractive partner for international partnerships in space science and exploration
- It presents all the calls. 
- Our call is included in the H2020-EO-2015:
   Actions will be funded in 2015 which have high business potential and are developing space enabled EO products and applications close to the market
- EO-3-2015: Technology developments for competitive imaging from space
