		\hline 
		Research and innovation & The project must be ambitious and use all available resources to obtain the best result. In this way, it must include the most appropriate technology that there is so far and, if it is in the development phase, add a section of research. 
		\\ 
		\hline 
		Quality & The content of the project documentation must be clear, complete and understandable. Furthermore, it must be well structured, dividing the information into approach, development and conclusions.
		All the documentation included in the project must first pass through an inspection of the quality department.
