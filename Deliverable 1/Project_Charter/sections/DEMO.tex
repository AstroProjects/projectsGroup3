\begin{itemize}
	\item Create a specific data logging device for the given Electro Field Meter (EFM).
	\item Provide the required power supply to the field mill on-board the UAV. 
	\item Integrate the EFM to the payloads bay.

\end{itemize}

	\item[Ground stations] The most common procedure is to attract the lightnings to a tall tower fully monitored. When a thunderstorm is unchained near the tower, there are strong chances of lightnings hits, which can be studied. The main drawback is that the tower must be placed on a usually thunderstorms zone where attract lightnings don't represent a risk to humans lives. Used all-round the world.  
	\item[Rocket triggering] A rocket is launch with an electric wire attached to its bottom, when the atmosphere conditions are favourable for a lightning discharge. When te conductor hit the  charged cloud a lightning falls along the wire. Then is measured by the sensors on the ground. Rocket triggering method is currently used by the \textit{Lightning Research Group of Florida University} with great results.
