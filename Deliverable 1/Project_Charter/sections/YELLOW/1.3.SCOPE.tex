\subsection{Scope}


The SCOPE for this project is:

\begin{itemize}

	\item State of the art of the current space applications and requirements of the following optical and radar systems:

		\begin{itemize}

		\item LIDAR
		\item Radar
		\item Super-spectral
		\item Hyperspectral
		\item Limb sounders
		\item Gravimetry
		\item High quantum efficiency photodetectors
		\item High precision optical beam scanning and pointing
		\item Advanced infra-red technologies

		\end{itemize}

	\item State of the art of the contributions of current space technologies to urban development.

	\item Selection of the most promising systems to profit Earth Observation to air composition and terrain analysis.
	
	\item Research of the selected systems to determine how can they be improved. 
	
	\item Development of sensor's preliminary design defining the minimum performance parameters in order to improve the existing technologies.

	\item Development of a software and interaction platform that treats the collected data and presents the result to its costumers. 

	\item Manufacture of a technology demonstrator by following the preliminary design.

	\item Testing and validation of the demonstrator in a space simulated environment.

	\item Design closure of the product.

\end{itemize}

The following items are considered to be OUT of the SCOPE of this project:

\begin{itemize}

	\item The launch and deployment of satellites that integrate this new technologies into space.
	\item The satellites monitoring. 
	\item Communication and transfer of data between the satellite and the ground station. 

\end{itemize}
