\section{Quality Assurance Approach}
One of the most important parts of the project is to ensure high quality levels in all its sections in order to provide a final product that meets the expectations of possible future cutomers. In this section, the procedures and methods to ensure this high quality are detailed. 

At this point, it is important to recall the defined high-level technical requirements defined previously in the Project Charter:

The quality assurance will be applied in different steps of the project. Before manufacturing the prototype, a quality procedure must be applied over the final design to ensure it meets the requirements of the project. The procedures executed in the manufacture of the prototype must be validated guarantee that they are suitable for the manufacture of the product. Finally, the final product must be revised to ensure it fulfills the expected specifications. This validations will contain methods to check the quality of the software and the hardware of the project.
