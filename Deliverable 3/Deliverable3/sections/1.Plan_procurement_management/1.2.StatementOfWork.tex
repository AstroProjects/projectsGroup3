\section{Statement Of Work}
The Statement Of Work (SOW) is developed for each contract taking into account the scope baseline of the project. The SOW describes the procurement item and its needs in detail to allow sellers to determine if they are capable of providing the products or services.
In the following tables, a description of the procurement items, requirements, type of contract and others are shown for each of the buying decisions.
