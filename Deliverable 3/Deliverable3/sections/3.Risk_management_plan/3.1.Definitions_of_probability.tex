\section{Definitions of Probability}
\label{3.1}
Two parameters are commonly used in order to model risk: the probability that something might happen and the impact it would have if it did happen. Therefore, to evaluate the probability of the potential risk to occur it is crucial to define and quantify it properly. 

A scale of 1\% to 100\% will be used for Probability, which is linearly divided into five sections represented in Table \ref{definitionsofprobability}. In fact, the 1\% is associated with the minimum probability of a risk, meaning that it will very rarely occur; while the maximum 100\% means the risk will be unavoidable.
