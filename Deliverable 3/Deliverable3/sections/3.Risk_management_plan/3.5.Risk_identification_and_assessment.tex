\section{Risk identification and assessment}

In this section as risk identification and assessment is provided by taking into account the defined data of the previous sections. Here it is also provided the information about the revised-risks. 

The factors that have been used in the identification process are: enterprise environmental factors, organizational process assets, the project scope statement and the project management plan.

It is worth to mention that after analyzing these points, risks have been classified in two main groups: External risks, which are risks the project team cannot control and therefor no response nor action can be defined, and Internal risks, which can be detected in advance and be addressed properly.
