\section{Communication process}

\textbf{Informal}

Informal communications consist of e-mail, conversations, or phone calls and serve to supplement and enhance formal communications. Due to the varied types and ad-hoc nature of informal communications, they are not discussed in this plan.

\textbf{Formal}

The <Project Name> Project will engage in various types of formal communication. The general types and their purpose are described below as “Status Meetings” and “Status Reports”.

\textbf{Status Meetings}

There are five basic types of status meetings for the <Project Name> Project:

Status meetings internal to the <Project Name> business team to discuss assignments, activities, and to share information; 
Status meetings and reports between the <Project Name> business team, and the technical project team; 
Advisory Committee meetings with the project stakeholders, and project manager to review progress, risks, and issues;
Status meetings and reports between the <Project Name> project manager and the steering committee; and 
Status meetings and reports to stakeholders, such as oversight agencies.



\textbf{Status Reports}

A variety of status reports will be produced during the project. The status reports will be produced on regular intervals to provide stakeholders project information on the status and progress of the <Project Name> project. At a minimum the reports will contain:

• Project status on major activities
\newline
•	Project schedule
\newline
•	Budget and cost tracking
\newline
•	Status of issues and risks
\newline
•	Health status
\newline
•	Status of action items, if applicable.
\newline
•	Future or planned activities

The intent of the status reports is to inform stakeholders of the project’s progress and keep them actively involved in the project. The information provided will contain enough detail to allow stakeholders to make informed decisions and maintain oversight of the project.

\textbf{External Communication}

If applicable, indicate the types of external communications that may be necessary in this project.
