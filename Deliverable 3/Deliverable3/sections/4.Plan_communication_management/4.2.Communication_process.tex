\section{Communication process}

[PONER UNA INTRODUCCION]

\textbf{Informal}

Informal communications consist of e-mail, conversations, or phone calls and serve to supplement and enhance formal communications. Due to the varied types and ad-hoc nature of informal communications, they are not discussed in this plan.

\textbf{Formal}

The DEOS-UD Project will engage in various types of formal communication. The general types and their purpose are described below as “Status Meetings” and “Status Reports”.

\textbf{Status Meetings}

There are five basic types of status meetings for the DEOS-UD Project:
 \begin{itemize}
	\item Status meetings internal to the DEOS-UD business team to discuss assignments, activities, and to share information
	\item Status meetings and reports between the DEOS-UD business team, and the technical project team
	\item Advisory Committee meetings with the project stakeholders, and project manager to review progress, risks, and issues
	\item Status meetings and reports between the DEOS-UD project manager and the steering committee
	\item Status meetings and reports to stakeholders, such as oversight agencies
 \end{itemize}

\textbf{Status Reports}

A variety of status reports will be produced during the project. The status reports will be produced on regular intervals to provide stakeholders project information on the status and progress of the DEOS-UD project. At a minimum the reports will contain:
 \begin{itemize}
	\item Project status on major activities
	\item Project schedule
	\item Budget and cost tracking
	\item Status of issues and risks
	\item Health status	
	\item Status of action items, if applicable.
	\item Future or planned activities
 \end{itemize}

The intent of the status reports is to inform stakeholders of the project’s progress and keep them actively involved in the project. The information provided will contain enough detail to allow stakeholders to make informed decisions and maintain oversight of the project.

\textbf{External Communication}

If applicable, indicate the types of external communications that may be necessary in this project.
