\chapter{Plan communication management}
This section stands for an accurate description of the communication management inside the DEOS-UD Project, as communication is one of the keys to a successful development of any project. 
In the first insight, the different roles and responsibilities will be described as well as the different relations between people, teams, and committees inside DEOS-UD. Along with the detailed roles and responsibilities of teams and committees, every memberâ€™s specific task inside them will be mentioned. 
Secondly, the different communication procedures will be carefully detailed to provide the maximum information possible in order to allow a correct development of meetings and communications between people and departments, thus increasing the overall project efficiency. 
The section will end with a communication management plan matrix, which will summarize all the previously described procedures by mapping all the communication requirements of the project.
