\section{Activity cost estimation}

In order to determine the cost of each task, all required resources were assigned, being personnel, hardware, software, and facilities four differentiated blocks.

Facilities and personnel costs were estimated based on hourly rates and hardware and software were assigned a purchasing price that is distributed among the task based on their use during the project. Meaning that those tasks that use software and hardware for more hours are charged a proportionally higher percentage of the acquisition cost. The use of personnel and facilities is charged for every hour of use.
