\section{Project Acceptance Criteria}

The acceptance criteria establish the requirements that must be met for the client to accept the project. These criteria are quantifiable, demonstrable and verifiable in such a way as to demonstrate that the project has been carried out properly, that is why, if these criteria are not met, a deliverable of the project cannot be considered valid.

	Research and innovation & The project must be ambitious and use all the available resources to obtain the best result. In this way, it must include the most appropriate technology that there is so far and, if it is in the development phase, add a section of research.\vspace{0.2cm} \\
	
	\midrule
	
	Quality & The content of the project documentation must be clear, complete and understandable. Furthermore, it must be well structured, dividing the information into approach, development and conclusions.\vspace{0.2cm}
	\newline
	All the documentation included in the project must first pass through an inspection of the quality department.\vspace{0.2cm} \\
	
	\midrule
	
	Sustainability & The product must be sustainable using renewable energy as much as possible and avoiding excessively polluting emissions. The materials used in the project must be reliable and guarantee the agreed useful life of the product.\vspace{0.2cm} \\
	
	\midrule	
	
	Schedule & The organization must be well structured and the deadlines must be met in a timely manner so that the development of the product is appropriate.\vspace{0.2cm} \\
	
	\midrule	
	
	Social contribution & The product must be able to solve a current problem and improve the quality of life of people using technology.\vspace{0.2cm} \\

	\midrule
	
	Test and validations & The evaluation and validation tests must be carried out periodically and be registered in the project documentation, in such a way that there is a record of the different versions of the application throughout the development.\vspace{0.2cm}
	\newline
	The information of these tests must be presented clearly and refer to the regulations concerned, in addition to be verifiable.\vspace{0.2cm}
	\newline
	The results of these tests should be used to analyze the service level of the application and improve on later versions.\vspace{0.2cm} \\
	
	\midrule
	
	Technical documents & The application must have a user manual both internally and externally and attach the necessary information for its development.\vspace{0.2cm}
	\newline
	The performance of the final product must be reflected in a data sheet. It must also be included in the documentation the datasheet of the different components that are part of the application.\vspace{0.2cm} \\
	
	\midrule
	
	Viability & The project must be viable economically and technically, so that its realization is possible.\vspace{0.2cm}
	\newline
	The different parts of the project must be submitted at the individual level to a study that checks if it is possible to do them and, if not, search for an alternative.\vspace{0.2cm}
