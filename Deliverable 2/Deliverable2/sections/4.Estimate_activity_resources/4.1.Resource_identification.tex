\section{Resource identification}
In this section the resources available/needed to perform the project will be exposed. These resources will be classified into three different categories: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Employees: People needed to achieve the objectives of the project. The employees will be provided by the members of the consortium. As not all employees are in the same point on the learning curve, they will be classified into three sub-groups: 
\begin{itemize}
\item Senior: High on the learning curve. They are able to provide guidance on technical and management issues and offer a critical point of view of the actions of the project.
\item Average: They are able to perform activities on their knowledge field and arrive to conclusions without supervision.
\item Junior: Little experience in the field, the work done needs to be supervised by an average employee.
\end{itemize}
\item Materials: Hardware and software elements that will be used to achieve the project objectives.
\item Facilities: Special places and services (such as the testing room). 
\end{itemize}
The resources are exposed in Table \ref{table_resourcesidentification}.
